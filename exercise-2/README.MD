## Assignment

Write a very simple chat server that should listen on TCP port 10000 for clients.
The chat protocol is very simple, clients connect with "telnet" and write single lines of text.
On each new line of text, the server will broadcast that line to all other connected clients. 
Your program should be fully tested too. (provide a link to your solution)


### How To Run

Run the command `gradlew run`, then wait for the message `Ready To Listen on Port: 10000` that will show up in the console.
